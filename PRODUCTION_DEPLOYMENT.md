## üöÄ Build and Submit Commands

### **1. Build Production AAB**

Build an Android App Bundle for final testing:

```bash
npx eas-cli build -p android --profile production
```

This will:
- Create an optimized AAB file
- Use the production configuration
- Upload to EAS servers for building
- Provide a download link when complete

**Estimated time:** 10-20 minutes

---

### **2. Test the Production Build**

Before submitting to Play Store, you should test the production build:

1. Download the AAB from EAS
2. Upload to Google Play Console's **Internal Testing** track
3. Install on test devices via Play Store
4. Verify all features work correctly with `TEST_MODE=false`

---

### **3. Submit to Play Store**

When ready for production release:

```bash
npx eas-cli submit -p android --latest
```

This will:
- Take the most recent production build
- Submit it directly to Google Play Console
- Require you to have configured Play Store credentials in EAS

**Alternative:** Manually upload the AAB to Play Console if you prefer.
